why webpack

It lets you write modular code and bundle it together into small packages to optimize load time.

js,css,html -> one file(build file)//bundle.js

cmd - npm run build  

webpack advantage--

imp--

1.webpack can do many optimizations to reduce the output size. It also cares about request caching by using hashes.

2.webpack allows you to split your codebase into chunks. Chunks are loaded on demand. This reduces initial loading time.

babel - to run our jsx files(which makes inturns to convert like html syntax)/ follow the es6 methos in the project


jsx 

JSX is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript.

1.Just like XML, JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children. 
2.If an attribute value is enclosed in quotes, the value is a string. Otherwise, wrap the value in braces and the value is the enclosed JavaScript expression.

<div className="red">Children Text</div>;
<MyCounter count={3 + 5} />;

3.JSX is faster because it performs optimization while compiling code to JavaScript.
4.It is also type-safe and most of the errors can be caught during compilation.
5.JSX makes it easier and faster to write templates if you are familiar with HTML.

react installation

Install Node on your system

npm > 3.8.8
node > 4.5.10

command:  npm install create-react-app -g //generator //facebook //

1.react-scripts includes babel,webpack,npm dependencies like the parent react,reactDomn


path where node_modules reside in mac term - /usr/local/lib/node_modules

in windows -  C:\Program Files\nodejs\node_modules

go to command and redirect to desktop path

desktop> create-react-app mythriApp

cd mythriApp

check node_modules folder is created after the command

npm install (on project path)

core - react,reactDom

dev dep - 


react w/o generator installation

-- mkdir sampleProject
- cd sampleProject

-- create a package.json for project

cmd:npm init
name,author,version,keyword

create pakg.json file

- npm install react --save-dev
- npm install react-dom --save-dev
